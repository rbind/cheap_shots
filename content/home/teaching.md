I am the instructor for the following courses at University of Nebraska-Lincoln:

- [NRES 222 Ecology Lab][nres222]
- NRES 450/850 Biology of Wildlife Populations
- NRES 800 Sampling, Data Management and Visualization
- [NRES 803 Ecological Statistics][nres803]

I sometimes give workshops on analyzing data with R:

- [Making the switch: A beginner’s guide to R for those familiar with other packages](/classes/esa2018_workshop/)


Follow [these instructions](/classes/computer-setup/) to set up your computer to use R prior to the first class or start of your workshop.
