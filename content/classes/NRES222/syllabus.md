## Expectations

We expect that you will come to every class on time and let us know ahead of time if you have a problem. If you are going to miss a lab, let us know before hand. If you let us know afterward there is no guarantee that we can help you make up the lab. We also expect that you will turn assignments in on time and do your best to understand the material. This might require that you ask questions- so please, don’t be shy. Finally, we would like you to read the section on academic honesty. If you have any questions about this, please ask.

We will be going off campus three times during lab period for field activities.  **It is critical that students be on time for departure.**  Meet in Hardin Hall North Lobby (near HarH 163) unless otherwise announced. We will try to always return to Hardin Hall by 5:00pm, but you should let the instructors know if you have a tight schedule after lab (job, class, meeting).  It may be possible for you to drive separately, but please make an arrangement with the TA. When lab meets on campus, some activities will require the full 3 hours while others may not.  An overview of activities for lab each week will always be posted on Canvas prior to lab.  Check Canvas to see if we are going in the field and if any special preparation is necessary.

## Assessment / Grading {#assessment}

## Course Policies

### Late Assignments

Unless you have a good reason ("my computer's down" doesn't qualify), I
cannot give full credit for late assignments - it is not fair to
everyone else. Work received up to one week late after the due date will
lose a grade (10%). Work received more than one week late up until the
last day of class will lose two grades (20%). All assignments will be
turned in via Canvas so they will be timestamped. Always keep a
digital or hard copy of assignments you turn in. All paper discussion
assignments must be turned in on time; no late summaries will be
accepted.

### Academic Integrity Statement

Students are expected to adhere to guidelines concerning academic
dishonesty outlined in Article III B.1 of University's [Student Code of
Conduct](http://stuafs.unl.edu/dos/code). A first offense will result in
a 10% penalty on the assignment. A second offense will result in a grade
of zero for the assignment. A third offense will result in a grade of F
for the course. Students are encouraged to contact the instructor for
clarification of these guidelines if they have questions or concerns.
The SNR policy on Academic Dishonesty and procedures for appeals are
available
[here](http://snr.unl.edu/employeeinfo/information/employeehandbook-single.asp?infocode=S162).

### Students with Disabilities {#disabilities}

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for
a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic
accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to
provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with
documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully
participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To
receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the
Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield
Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

### In case of emergency 

#### Fire Alarm (or other evacuation)

In the event of a fire alarm: Gather belongings (Purse, keys, cellphone,
N-Card, etc.) and use the nearest exit to leave the building. Do not use
the elevators. After exiting notify emergency personnel of the location
of persons unable to exit the building. Do not return to building unless
told to do so by emergency personnel.

#### Tornado Warning

When sirens sound, move to the lowest interior area of building or
designated shelter. Stay away from windows and stay near an inside wall
when possible.

#### Active Shooter

Evacuate: if there is a safe escape path, leave belongings behind, keep
hands visible and follow police officer instructions.

Hide out: If evacuation is impossible secure yourself in your space by
turning out lights, closing blinds and barricading doors if possible.

Take action: As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent
danger, attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the active shooter.

UNL Alert: Notifications about serious incidents on campus are sent via
text message, email, unl.edu website, and social media. For more
information go to: <http://unlalert.unl.edu>.

Additional Emergency Procedures can be found here:
