<p>This week will give you further practice with making plots, estimating linear models in R, and getting predicted values from those fitted models. Create a new project in RStudio named “yourlastname_lab2”. Submit the compressed project directory, which should include an R Markdown file that can be compiled directly to html without errors. The answers to the numbered questions should be in plain text. The code should be in R code chunks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Load the NRES803 and NRES803data packages. If you are using the lab template, this can go in the setup chunk.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
library(&quot;broom&quot;)
library(&quot;NRES803&quot;)
library(&quot;NRES803data&quot;)
data(RIKZ)
dim(RIKZ)</code></pre>
<p>This file has 45 observations and 89 variables. Many of those variables are abundance measures for single species. These are in columns 2 through 76. To calculate species richness for each site we need to first use a logical variable to seperate the zeros from positive abundances. Then we add up each row. We can use a convenient function rowSum() that calculates the sum of each row in a matrix. The “&gt;0” part converts the count observations of species in columns 2 through 76 into presence/absence of each species. The result is a single vector that contains the species richness, or alpha diversity, of each site in the dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ$Richness &lt;- rowSums(RIKZ[,2:76] &gt; 0)
dim(RIKZ)</code></pre>
<p>You can see that we now have one more variable than before. Now we want to plot species richness against NAP, which is a measure of how far up the beach the sampling location is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># make &quot;Beach&quot; into a factor otherwise treated as continuous
RIKZ$fBeach &lt;- factor(RIKZ$Beach)
Richness_NAP &lt;- ggplot(RIKZ, aes(x = NAP, y = Richness)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=fBeach))
Richness_NAP</code></pre>
<p>I’ve saved the output of <code>ggplot()</code> into a variable so that I can simply reuse that object later when I want to add something to the plot. This isn’t necessary, but saves on copying and pasting code if you’re making the same plot multiple times. Now we fit a linear model to that data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ_model.1 &lt;- lm(Richness ~ NAP, data = RIKZ)
summary(RIKZ_model.1)</code></pre>
<p>You’ve already done some interpretation of that model in the <a href="/classes/NRES803/readiness/">readiness assessment</a>. Let’s take a look at the assumptions of that model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_RIKZ &lt;- augment(RIKZ_model.1, data=RIKZ)
ggplot(test_RIKZ, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=fBeach)) + 
  geom_smooth()

# this is lifted out of base R qqline()
y &lt;- quantile(test_RIKZ$.resid, c(0.25, 0.75))
x &lt;- qnorm(c(0.25, 0.75))
slope &lt;- diff(y)/diff(x)
int &lt;- y[1L] - slope * x[1L]

ggplot(test_RIKZ, aes(sample = .resid)) + 
  stat_qq() + 
  geom_abline(slope = slope, intercept = int)

ggplot(test_RIKZ, aes(x = .fitted, y = sqrt(abs(.std.resid)))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1)

ggplot(test_RIKZ, aes(.hat, .std.resid)) +
 geom_vline(size = 2, colour = &quot;white&quot;, xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(size = 2, colour = &quot;white&quot;, yintercept = 0) +
  geom_point(aes(size = .cooksd)) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE)</code></pre>
<ol class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Briefly interpret what those plots are telling you about each of the four assumptions of the linear model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next we will look for other important variables. It would not be uncommon for ecological communities to vary over time.</p>
<ol start="2" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Plot species richness against the variable week. Save the plot object in an object named <code>richness_week</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you think the timing of the sample collection matters? Test your intuition with a linear model</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ_model.2 = lm(Richness ~ week, data = RIKZ)
summary(RIKZ_model.2)</code></pre>
<ol start="3" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does week of sampling affect species richness? How well does the fitted line represent the variation among weeks? (hint graphically check assumptions)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that there are only 4 weeks, with multiple observations per week. Another way to analyse this type of variable is to treat it as a categorical variable, and estimate a different parameter for each week. We can do this quickly like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ_model.3 &lt;- lm(Richness~factor(week), data=RIKZ)</code></pre>
<p>However, this ends up labeling the parameters as factor(week) which is a bit odd, and makes it more difficult to do predictions from the model. A better approach is to change the variable in the dataframe:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ$fweek &lt;- factor(RIKZ$week)
RIKZ_model.3 &lt;- lm(Richness ~ fweek, data = RIKZ)</code></pre>
<ol start="4" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which model, 2 or 3, is a better predictor of Species Richness? Does model 3 fit the assumptions of the linear model?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we would like to find out what the estimated species richness is in each week. We could do the calculations manually, but there is a better way that uses the fitted model object. First we need a data.frame that contains one row for each estimate, and one column for each covariate in the model that we want to predict from. We can call this data.frame anything, but I prefer to call it nd, for “new data”. In our case, we are going to have 4 rows, one for each week, as a factor called fweek:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nd &lt;- data.frame(fweek=factor(levels(RIKZ$fweek)))
# There is a lot going on in that one line of code. The best way to break this down is to run each piece from the “inside” out, so:
RIKZ$fweek  # shows us the original data
levels(RIKZ$fweek) # gives a vector of the unique levels
factor(levels(RIKZ$fweek)) # creates a new “factor”
# create a data.frame with one column called fweek
data.frame(fweek=factor(levels(RIKZ$fweek)))
# and save it in an object named ‘nd’
nd &lt;- data.frame(fweek=factor(levels(RIKZ$fweek)))</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you come across a bit of R code that is doing something complicated, you can use this approach to decompose what is going on. This is a very powerful way to learn R.</p>
<p>Now we need to use the nd data.frame, together with the fitted model object, to get the predicted values:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>augment(RIKZ_model.3, newdata=nd, se_fit = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This gives us a dataframe of mean species richness in each week and the standard errors.
So the mean species richness in week 3 is 4.2±0.96 (SE). That’s nice, but it would be nicer if we could plot it on a figure. Save the predicted means and standard errors to an object named ‘predicted.Richness’ and make the plot again.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>predicted.Richness &lt;- augment(RIKZ_model.3, newdata=nd, se_fit = TRUE)

# have to set color explicitly otherwise looks for fbeach in predicted.Richness
richness_week + geom_point(aes(x = fweek, y = .fitted), color = &quot;red&quot;, data = predicted.Richness)</code></pre>
<p>That will fail with an error about a discrete value being supplied to a continuous scale. The problem is that we made the object richness_week with week not fweek. So let’s redo that object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>predicted.Richness &lt;- augment(RIKZ_model.3, newdata=nd, se_fit = TRUE)
# redo the plot object
richness_week &lt;- ggplot(RIKZ, aes(x = fweek, y = Richness, color = fBeach)) + 
  geom_point()
# have to set color explicitly otherwise looks for fbeach in predicted.Richness
richness_week + geom_point(aes(x = fweek, y = .fitted), color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2, data = predicted.Richness) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = fweek, 
                    ymin = .fitted - 1.96*.se.fit,
                    ymax = .fitted + 1.96*.se.fit), color = &quot;red&quot;, data = predicted.Richness, inherit.aes = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>This same procedure works with continuous variables too. If we only have a single linear covariate we can add <code>geom_smooth(method = "lm")</code> to plot the fitted line but that won’t work for more complex models or for categorical variables.</p>
<p>Both NAP and fweek seem to affect the response. Fit a linear regression model with main effects of both NAP and fweek, like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ_model.4 = lm(Richness ~ NAP + fweek, data = RIKZ)</code></pre>
<ol start="5" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Examine the summary for this model and compare with the previous models.Also compare the coefficients for NAP and fweek with those estimated in models 1 and 3 – are the qualitative conclusions (sign and magnitude) different when the variables are combined in a single model?</li>
</ol>
<p>Making a plot with a more complex model is a bit involved. The problem is that we now have to make predictions with <em>both</em> NAP and fweek. So we are going to get 4 lines on a plot of Richness vs. NAP; one for each week.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nd = expand.grid(NAP=seq(-1.5,2.5,0.1), fweek=factor(levels(RIKZ$fweek)))
predicted.Richness.4 &lt;- augment(RIKZ_model.4, newdata = nd)

# reuse ggplot object from above. fix color to black or geom_line looks for fBeach. x aesthetic inherited from Richness_NAP
Richness_NAP + geom_line(aes(y = .fitted, group = fweek, linetype = fweek), color = &quot;black&quot;, data = predicted.Richness.4)</code></pre>
<p>It is important that the variable fweek in nd has the same levels as the variable that was used to fit the model; specifying the levels is the best way to ensure this. Notice that the lines are all parallel – that is because we fitted a model with no interaction between the continuous variable NAP and the factor variable fweek. Effectively we have 4 intercepts and one slope.</p>
<p>Now fit a model that includes both NAP, fweek, and their interaction:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RIKZ_model.5 = lm(Richness~NAP*fweek,data=RIKZ)</code></pre>
<p>Look carefully to see the difference in the code – it is a single character! However that single change adds 3 parameters to our model. Now we have 8 parameters, essentially an intercept and slope for each week.</p>
<ol start="6" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Examine the summary for this model and compare with the previous models.Also compare the coefficients for NAP and fweek with those estimated in models 1, 3 and 4 – are the qualitative conclusions (sign and magnitude) different with the interaction?</li>
</ol>
<p>The three interaction coefficients can be thought of as a change in the slope of NAP for weeks 2, 3 and 4. So we expect the line for week 2 to be shallower (less negative), while weeks 3 and 4 should be steeper (more negative). Confirm this interpretation by repeating the figure above using model 5 to get the predictions.</p>
<ol start="7" class="example" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Which model would you choose to make inferences from and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Looking at the figure from <code>RIKZ_model.5</code>, are there any features that would cause concern from an <em>ecological</em> (as opposed to a statistical) perspective? Look carefully at the expected values of species richness for each week (the plotted lines).</p></li>
</ol>
