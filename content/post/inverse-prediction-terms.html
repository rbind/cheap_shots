<p>One of the exercises I make Ecological Statistics students do is
<a href="/classes/NRES803/Week_2/homework_2/">work backwards from a given value of the dependent variable in a regression
to the corresponding values of the independent variable</a>. I usually just get them
to eyeball it from a table of predictions. But today a student suggested the
“terms” type of prediction might be the answer. Unfortunately I’ve never
tried to figure out what type = “terms” actually does<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. What is this magic?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
df &lt;- tibble(x1 = 1:10,
             x2 = rep(1:5, each = 2),
             y1 = -5 + 1 * x1 + rnorm(10),
             y2 = 0 + 1 * x1 - 1 * x2 + rnorm(10),
             y3 = 25 -10 * x1 + 1 * x1^2) 
mod1 &lt;- lm(y1~x1, data = df)
mod2 &lt;- lm(y1~x1 + x2, data = df)
mod3 &lt;- lm(y1~x1 + x1^2, data = df)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = df) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x1, y = y1), method = &quot;lm&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>

<p>OK, so we’ve got three models, one with a single predictor, one with two predictors, and one with a polynomial model. When there is a single
predictor, there is only a single value of the independent variable that
gives that value of the dependent variable. In mathematical terms the linear
function is “invertible” – you can run it both ways and get a unique
answer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>predict(mod1, type = &quot;terms&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##            x1
## 1  -5.0070087
## 2  -3.8943401
## 3  -2.7816715
## 4  -1.6690029
## 5  -0.5563343
## 6   0.5563343
## 7   1.6690029
## 8   2.7816715
## 9   3.8943401
## 10  5.0070087
## attr(,&quot;constant&quot;)
## [1] 0.4617342</code></pre>
<p>OK, if that was useful for “inverse prediction” I expect it would be related to the values of x1, but it isn’t. It’s the fitted value (y) plus a constant. A bit of digging online reveals that it is
the fitted value for that particular term, after centering the
independent variable. The constant is related to the centering process.
In all the digging I couldn’t figure out
what one uses the terms type for. I’m sure it’s good for something, I
just don’t know what! Suggestions in the comments please.</p>
<p>So the question of easily doing inverse prediction is unanswered. Stay tuned for part 2 though, I did learn something in my digging!</p>
