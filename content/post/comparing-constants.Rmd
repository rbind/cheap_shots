[One of the exercises in Ecological Statistics](/classes/Week_1/lab_1/)
fits a species area curve to data from the Galapogos Islands. I ask students
to compare the estimated power coefficient $z$ with the value 0.27 reported in [a meta-analysis by Drakare et al. 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00848.x). But Drakare et al. only reported the mean, not the standard error.[^1]

To do the comparison properly, I need to know how uncertain the average $z$ is. I looked through the paper carefully, but couldn't find a standard error anywhere! The individual estimates used in the meta-analysis are in an appendix, but the standard errors are not reported there either. They do 
exist, because Drakare et al. discuss the value of a "weighted" average, 
where poor estimates (large SE) of $z$ get reduced weight. Oh well, I'll
do the best I can.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("NRES803") #devtools::install_github("atyre2/NRES803")
library("faraway") # for the data
drakare <- read_csv(here::here("content/post/data/Drakare_etal_2006_species-area-curves-review.csv"))
```
The data come from Johnson and Raven (1973); I should check if any of the
estimates in the Drakare data come from there.

```{r}
grep("Raven", drakare$Oref)
drakare[193:197,"Oref"]
```

OK, we need to remove row 194. I included rows before and after the
hits because sometimes more than one estimate is taken from a single
reference, and the references are missing for those extra rows. 

```{r}
drakare <- drakare[-194,]
```

OK. Now I'll get a mean and standard error for all the studies.

```{r}
drakare %>% 
  summarize(mean_z = mean(z_power),
            se_z = sd(z_power)/sqrt(n()))
```

Oh right, there are some studies that didn't report z for the power method. 
I could use `na.rm = TRUE` for both `mean()` and `sd()`, but then
`n()` would be reporting the incorrect number. 

```{r}
drakare %>% 
filter(!is.na(z_power)) %>% 
  summarize(mean_z = mean(z_power),
            se_z = sd(z_power)/sqrt(n()),
            n = n())
```
Cooool. The SE is tiny because there are so many observations. Also, 
weighting the observations by their variance makes quite a difference -- 
the weighted value reported is 0.27 compared to 0.30 unweighted. 

OK, but before I get carried away, Drakare et al. did find differences by
method (nested vs. independent) and "realm" (aquatic vs. terrestrial). 

```{r}
z_estimates <- drakare %>% 
filter(!is.na(z_power)) %>% 
  group_by(method, Realm) %>% 
  summarize(mean_z = mean(z_power),
            se_z = sd(z_power)/sqrt(n()),
            n = n())
z_estimates
```

The Galapagos data is terrestrial and independent, because each observation
is a distinct island. Now get the estimated coefficient of z for the Galapagos islands.

```{r}
gala.1 <- lm(log(Species)~log(Area),data=gala)
summary(gala.1)
```

[Consulting wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Independent_(unpaired)_samples) I believe I want

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}}{s_{\bar{\Delta}}}
$$

where

$$
s_{\bar{\Delta}} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
$$

I already have the things inside the square root; they are the square of the
estimated standard errors. So ... 

```{r}
gala.coefs <- tidy(gala.1)
s_combined <- sqrt(z_estimates[4, "se_z"]^2 + gala.coefs[2, "std.error"]^2)
s_combined
```

which is ever so slightly bigger than the se from the model alone.

```{r}
t <- (gala.coefs[2, "estimate"] - z_estimates[4, "mean_z"])/s_combined
t
```

OK, to get a p value for that, I need to get the degrees of freedom ... 
it's ugly. 

```{r}
(z_estimates[4, "se_z"]^2 + gala.coefs[2, "std.error"]^2)^2 /
  (z_estimates[4, "se_z"]^4/433 + gala.coefs[2, "std.error"]^4/28)

```

That makes sense ... it is a little bigger than the sample size for the
larger variance. 

```{r}
# have to coax t into a naked number, many ways to do this
pt(t[1,1, drop = TRUE], df = 34.15, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Nice -- so that is a test of the hypothesis that the estimated coefficient
from the Galapagos is the same as the unweighted average for all independently sampled
terrestrial systems. The p value is the probability of getting an estimate
as large as 0.39 *or larger*, given the null hypothesis was true. So the 
Galapagos Islands plant communities are not like the other things. I'm not
sure what to make of that ecologically, but
