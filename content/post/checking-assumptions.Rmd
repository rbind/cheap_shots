Many years ago I started making videos of my lectures for my ecological statistics course. I still use those early videos, [now on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUFo9SxNSLuaipofuL20_Ynd3QMFTLj18),
but a recent comment on [the checking assumptions video](https://youtu.be/E27HcS9QaT0) made me realize that I somehow misplaced 
the code that I used to create the figures in the powerpoints 
of the early videos. [^1]

Rather than try to reproduce the old code in a non-public way, I 
thought I would redo it here so it is easy to share. Plus, I get 
to show of the new function my students and I wrote for making 
nice residual plots with ggplot2. The exercise uses the horseshoe crab satellite male data from Agresti's book on categorical data analysis. 
If you would like the explanations of the figures have a look at the
video.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("glmbb") # install Ben Bolker's package 
data(crabs, package = "glmbb")
library("tidyverse")
library("broom")
library("NRES803") # devtools::install_github("atyre2/NRES803")
```

The video doesn't show it (it's in another video), but we first need to 
fit a linear model of female weight in grams as a function of carapace width in cm.

```{r}
hsc1 <- lm(weight~width, data = crabs)
summary(hsc1)
```

The first figure in the video is a histogram of the residuals, with 
the normal distribution superimposed.

```{r}
hist(residuals(hsc1), main = "Histogram of Residuals",
     freq = FALSE, col = NULL,
     xlab = "Residuals")
# add the normal curve with the residual standard error from model
curve(dnorm(x, sd = 264.1), from = -1000, to =1000, add = TRUE)
```

In the video I also mention the results of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test of the residuals vs. a normal distribution.

```{r}
ks.test(residuals(hsc1), "pnorm", 0, 264.1)
```

Then there's a quantile-quantile plot.

```{r}
qqnorm(residuals(hsc1))
qqline(residuals(hsc1))
```

Next is the output of the `plot()` on a linear model object.

```{r}
old.par <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(hsc1)
par(old.par)
```

My students and I put together a function that uses ggplot2
to make something similar. I like it because it includes
confidence regions, which makes it easier to judge if the 
smooth spline is "flat".

```{r featured-image, message=FALSE}
check_assumptions(hsc1)
```


One thing that plot makes clear is the presence of several 
outliers. In [The Ecological Detective](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Ecological_Detective/katmvQDi8PMC?hl=en), Ray Hilborn and Marc Mangel
have an entire section entitled "Don't let outliers ruin your life". 
In that spirit, the next few plots identify and eliminate the
outliers, and then refit the model. I'm going to switch
over to using `broom` functions here, because too easy.
I think in the video I remove the points with the largest 
absolute values of the residuals, which isn't necessarily
a good definition of an outlier.

```{r}
crabs <- augment(hsc1) # add model diagnostics 
#which points have biggest residuals
crabs |>   ## native pipe!!
  rownames_to_column()|>
  arrange(desc(abs(.resid))) |>
  head()

```

So rows 69, 26, 79, and 141 have large residuals, more than 50%
larger than the remainder. 

```{r}
outliers <- c(26, 69, 79, 141)
hsc2 <- lm(weight~width, data = crabs[-outliers,])
plot(weight~width, data = crabs)
points(crabs[outliers,2, drop = TRUE], crabs[outliers,1, drop = TRUE], pch = "x", col = "red")
abline(hsc2, lwd = 2)
abline(hsc1, lty = 2)
```

The "outliers" are identified with the red 'x's. The
original fit is given with a dashed line. How do the
residual plots look with the outliers removed?

```{r}
qqnorm(residuals(hsc2))
qqline(residuals(hsc2))
```

and finally checking for non-linearity by plotting 
residuals against the independent variable width.

```{r}
plot(crabs[-outliers, "width", drop = TRUE], residuals(hsc2), 
     xlab = "width [cm]", ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs. Independent")
abline(h = 0, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

and finally with the function from my package.

```{r}
check_assumptions(hsc2)
```
