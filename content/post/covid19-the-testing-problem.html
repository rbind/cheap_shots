<p>At least, from the standpoint of estimating the rate of increase. It certainly
affects the estimated number of cases. But if you just want to know if things
are growing less than exponentially, flawed data are OK.</p>
<p><a href="/post/covid-19_and_r/">The first post in this series was March 13</a>, in case you’re just joining and
want to see the progression. I’m now posting the bottom line figures for each <a href="/post/covid19-bottom-line-usa/">state</a> and <a href="/post/covid19-bottom-line-canada/">province</a> on
the same post that just gets updated each day.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: These unofficial results are not peer reviewed, and should not be
treated as such. My goal is to learn about forecasting in real time,
how simple models compare with more complex models, and even how to compare
different models.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Here’s why. Start with the simplest exponential growth model.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
N_{t+1} = N_t e^r
\]</span>
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the per capita rate of growth. When it is small, <span class="math inline">\(e^r \approx 1 +r\)</span>, so
you can think of it like an interest rate, the percentage of growth over
whatever period of time is represented by <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(N_t\)</span> is the number of cases on
day <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If we’re not testing everyone, then what we OBSERVE is <span class="math inline">\(C_t\)</span>, the
confirmed cases on day <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. There are lots of reasons why we don’t test everyone.
Some people have no symptoms. Some have a mild case and don’t see a doctor.
Some sick people DO see a doctor, but tests are limited, and unless you’re at
deaths door, knowing you have COVID-19 doesn’t change the treatment. So
some people who saw a doctor don’t get tested. Furthermore, even if you have
COVID-19 and get tested <a href="/post/my-covid19-story/">there is a pretty high probability of a negative test result</a>.
Let’s just lump all those processes together into a detection probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that determines
how many actual cases get confirmed.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C_t = p N_t
\]</span></p>
<p>Now substitute that relationship back into the exponential growth model.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{C_{t+1}}{p} = \frac{C_t}{p}e^r \\
C_{t+1} = C_t e^r
\]</span></p>
<p>So the detection probability cancels out, and the growth rate is the same. This is true as long
as the detection probability stays constant. One issue arises when a locale increases testing.
That will increase the probability of detection. What does that look like? Now we have a different
detection probability <span class="math inline">\(p&#39;\)</span> in the next time step.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{C_{t+1}}{p&#39;} = \frac{C_t}{p}e^r \\
C_{t+1} = C_t \frac{p&#39;}{p} e^r
\]</span></p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(p&#39; &gt; p\)</span>, an increase in the detection probability looks like an increase in the growth
rate. If the testing regime stabilizes again, then the growth rate will drop back to the
same level it was increasing at before.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
N_{t+1} = N_t e^r \\
I_t = N_{t+1} - N_t\\
N_{t+1} - N_t = N_t e^r - N_t \\
I_t = N_t (e^r - 1) \\
I_t \approx N_t r
\]</span></p>
